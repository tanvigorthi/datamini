<h2> How We Collect and Measure Data</h2>

<h3> Understanding Emissions and Carbon Footprint</h3>
<p> The first step is to gather data on the carbon footprints of data centers and LLM training facilities. This involves collecting detailed information on energy consumption, the sources of energy used (such as solar, wind, or coal), and the overall emissions produced during LLM training. These come from open data sources, such as governmental reports, and the companiesâ€™ documentation.  By quantifying these factors, we can understand the magnitude of the environmental impact associated with large-scale data operations and identify the primary sources of CO2 emissions. This foundational understanding is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate the environmental impact of LLMs. This helps provide us with an idea of what environmental factors are at play, and while this is not relevant to data minimization procedures, it is indicative of larger sustainability measures within companies.</p>
<h3> Collating Big Data</h3>
<p> Next, we will aggregate data from the existing databases. By creating a more comprehensive database, we can benchmark the environmental performance of various models and data centers. This data is sorted into outcomes and processes, as described in our analysis and deployment section. This database will serve as a valuable resource for comparing the carbon footprints of different LLM implementations and identifying best practices for reducing emissions. For future incoming data, we will utilize incoming-stream algorithms, this would allow us to reduce the need to sort and resort repeatedly.</p>
<h3> Addressing Ethical Concerns </h3>
<p> <b>How is data anonymized, privatized, and kept safe when it runs through a minimization process, especially one that results in large masses of data in one place at one time?</b></p>
<p>We do not store any of your data on our systems. In fact, our algorithms are designed to ensure that you can run all of these processes on your systems. We also ensure that all of our algorithms are encrypted. However, we recommend you toggle on the Anonymizer library, if the quality of your data allows it. We also recommend that all of the data is stripped of identifying details in case your model is trained on mathematical problems submitted by real people. However, we understand that many big data models require personal information to be accessible, which is why it is toggle-able. All our practices are SOC 2 compliant, and we do not retain any data, in any form. The model maintains access logs to all data, which track all movement. </p>
<p> <b> Does the creation of such a minimization system, especially one that collates all of this data in one place, not exacerbate previously existing environmental impacts?</b></p>
<p> The minimization process is meant to create a base idea for how much of your data is redundant. It is then designed to remove said data, and streamline your processes of storing, organizing, and accessing data. While the one-time occurrence of minimization may result in a large use of power, the ultimate goal of such a minimizer is to reduce the need for storage capacity that uses electricity, as well as make it so algorithmically expensive sorting algorithms and resources that would otherwise be used to create, sort, index, and organize, can be directed somewhere more productive.</p>
