<h2> Big Data and Electricity: Use Our Product To Minimize Your Carbon Footprint</h2>

  <p>Big data is revolutionary for many fields of environmental preservation. It can be used to track consumption patterns for water and electricity, to optimize city grids for better resource allocation. GIS mapping is helpful in a multitude of ways, allowing us to better understand the environmental impact of climate change on our geography. With all of these incredible promised revolutions that big data promises to bring around, it is easy to forget the environmental impact that data centers have.In 2022, data centers alone consumed more that 4% of the United Stateâ€™s electricity. Data collection is an energy suck, one that will cost the United States much of its electricity output. Addressing the footprint of big data collection centers is crucial to driving green efforts through big data. This project aims to minimize the impact of big data through efforts to cull the data into what is necessary. It aims to use systems of comparison and data sorting to optimize data collection into what is necessary. Off-loading some of the large amounts of data we have stored is one way to help take some of the load (so to speak) off the power grid, and help propel big data in a more green direction. </p>
